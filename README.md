## Summary
My dataset
## Source
My data of journalists and media workers killed since 1992 comes from [Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ)](https://cpj.org/data/). [CPJ](https://cpj.org/about/) is an independent non-profit that defends press freedom and supports the rights of journalists worldwide.
### [Methodology](https://cpj.org/data-methodology/)
A few key things that are important in our data analysis:
1. CPJ excludes journalists that "were clearly not killed for their journalism, or died in an accident/weather event or because of illness – even if the accident was work-related." 
2. CPJ researchers independently investigate and verify the circumstances behind each death by interviewing the victim's friends, families, and colleagues to learn about the details of each death. Such details include whether the journalist was on assignment at time of death, whether they had published content that could attract hostility, whether they had previous received threats, etc. 
  * CPJ "considers a case “confirmed” as work-related only when it appears certain that a journalist was murdered in direct reprisal for his or her work; in combat or crossfire; or while carrying out a dangerous assignment." 
  * In cases where CPJ cannot confirm whether the death of the journalist as clear motives but has a potential link to journalism, CPJ classifies it as "unconfirmed".
3. Since 2003, CPJ started recording the work-related deaths of translators, drivers, fixers, security guards, and administrative workers as they recognized the importance of these figures to journalism. CPJ classifes these figures as "media workers".
4. CPJ constantly monitors the judicial process for each confirmed murder case. There are three categories of impuntiy: "complete impunity" (no convictions have been obtained), "partial justice" (some but not all of those responsible have been convicted; typically, assassins are convicted but not those who ordered the killing), and "full justice" (everyone responsible is convicted, including perpetrators and those who commissioned them).

1. Press Freedom Index, compiled by Reporters Without Borders (RSF)](https://rsf.org/en/index): The press freedom index is a snapshot of the level of press freedom experienced by journalists and media in 180 countries and territories each year, based on the definition of "press freedom" by RSF. PFI ranges from 0-100, with 0 being the least amount of press freedom and 100 the most. According to RSF, "This score is calculated on the basis of two components: a quantitative tally of abuses against journalists in connection with their work, and against media outlets; a qualitative analysis of the situation in each country or territory based on the responses of press freedom specialists (including journalists, researchers, academics and human rights defenders) to an RSF questionnaire available in 23 languages."
